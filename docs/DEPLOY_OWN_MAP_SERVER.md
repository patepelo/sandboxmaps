# Deploy your maps files server

This doc explains how to deploy your own instance of a Sandbox Maps server with files from official CDNs (We are working to be able to download maps files without hardcoded countries.txt file embedded in the app)
We explain how to deploy with minimal config, but each tool has different options to change server port or choose maps files that you want to download.

## Deploy a server
Our community has developed different tools to deploy easily an instance of a Sandbox Maps server:
- [comaps-map-distributor](https://codeberg.org/gedankenstuecke/comaps-map-distributor)
- [comaps-server](https://github.com/myanesp/comaps-server)

### Deploy comaps-map-distributor

Prerequisites
- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- Your server must be accessible from your network

- Launch your terminal
- Run `pip install comaps-map-distributor`
- Launch the tool with this command `comaps-map-distributor download-maps`
- Choose map files you want to download from official CDNs
- Run `comaps-map-distributor serve-maps`
- Go to your mobile device -> Sandbox Maps -> settings -> Advanced -> Custom Maps server
- Edit URL with your URL server and enjoy

### Deploy comaps-server

Prerequisites
- Docker

  ghcr.io/myanesp/comaps-server:latest```
- Go to your mobile device -> Sandbox Maps -> settings -> Advanced -> Custom Maps server
- Edit URL with your URL server and enjoy   

#### Docker compose
- Launch your terminal
- Create a `compose.yml` file with this config and save it:

```services:
